This site is for providing a one stop location for information on wind, hurricanes, earthquakes, and weather forecast. The home page provides user a dropdown option menu to choose. When user selects and option, for example, General Weather Forecas, it will take users to forcast page where user is not able to enter zip code to find current weather. In this website, we included back button route, that will take users back to homepage to select any other option.
