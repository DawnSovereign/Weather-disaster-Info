# Run the program
This website serves as a comprehensive destination for obtaining information about wind, hurricanes, earthquakes, and weather forecasts. On the homepage, users are presented with a dropdown menu that offers a selection of options. For instance, if a user chooses "General Weather Forecast," they will be directed to a forecast page where they can enter a zip code to retrieve the current weather information. To enhance user navigation, a back button route has been implemented, allowing users to easily return to the homepage and choose a different option.

# Future work
In a future update, this website aims to expand its coverage by incorporating additional Disaster Weather information such as tornadoes, high temperature warnings, and wildfires. By including these additional features, the website will offer a more comprehensive and diverse range of information to its users. This expansion will ensure that users can access relevant and timely data related to various weather-related disasters, thereby enhancing their overall experience and keeping them better informed.
